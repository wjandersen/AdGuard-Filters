# AdGuard Filter

I am not content with just blocking traffic but also wanting to classify what it normally allowed. So here you will see three lists.
- Blocked
    - URLs that need blocking based on my traffic
- Allowed
    - URLs that need allowed based on my traffic
- Observed
    - URLs that have been noticed but haven't have a been assigned to another list yet.


If you are looking for an agressive list for AdGuard Home, then I would suggest the "Everything" list at https://blocklist.site/
